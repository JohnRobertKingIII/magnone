Magnone Elementary Kinematics & Dynamics Library
=================================================

About
-----

'Magnone' is a small Python project by myself, an undergrad pre-CSE major at The Ohio State University.
The aim is to compile together targeted algorithmic solutions to introductory college level kinematics and dynamics 
problems.

Rationale
---------

I have trouble deriving algorithms to solve more complex (complex being vastly relative here) 
college physics problems on-the-fly. My study solution was this project, in which I will analyse a range of problems
and gain experience working out how to solve them.

Suitability
-----------

Completely uncertain. I'm really only doing this on Github because "cloud availibity" and I'm really only doing this 
project for the experience of programming it, not using it. This is my own pet project. But hey, if you're searching along
for something like this, and I've just made your day, feel free to shoot me an email at(view raw): <king DOT 2047 AT osu DOT edu>
